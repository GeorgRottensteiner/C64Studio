 PAL-Timing scheme for two successive overscan raster lines, sprites 1+3+7 active
 on the latter:

  '-' = idle bus cycle (reads from the last byte of the video bank)
  '+' = idle bus cycle (just like '-', but reads from
        video_bank_base_address + $39FF if ECM (<A HREF="VIC17.HTM">$D011</A> Bit 6) is selected)

   &lt;num&gt; = pointer fetch for sprite &lt;num&gt;  ;  r = memory refresh cycle
   s = sprite data fetch  ;  N = extra '-' cycles for NTSC added here

   x  = processor executes instructions (BA high, AEC high)
   X  = bus request pending, bus still available (BA low, AEC high);
        processor may execute write cycles, stops on the next read cycle.
  '*' = bus request pending, bus still available (BA low, AEC high);
        processor is blocked because it would like to read something.
  '=' = bus unavailable (BA low, AEC low); processor is blocked because it
        would like to read something.
