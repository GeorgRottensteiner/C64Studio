  Desc="Showcases the usage of TSB (Tuned Simons' BASIC), using a second loader program which sets up TSB and loads the actual file. Uses a post build event to import files in a disk image, and how to pass the image on to an emulator. The loader is configured as dependency of the main testbild.bas file, so it is built along with it.">
