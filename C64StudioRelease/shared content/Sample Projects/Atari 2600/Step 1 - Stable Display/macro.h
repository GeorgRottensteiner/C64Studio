;
; 1.05  14/NOV/2003      - Added VERSION_MACRO equate (which will reflect 100x version #)
;                          This will allow conditional code to verify MACRO.H being
;                          used for code assembly.
; 1.04  13/NOV/2003     - SET_POINTER macro added (16-bit address load)
;
; 1.03  23/JUN/2003     - CLEAN_START macro added - clears TIA, RAM, registers
;
; 1.02  14/JUN/2003     - VERTICAL_SYNC macro added
;                         (standardised macro for vertical synch code)
; 1.01  22/MAR/2003     - SLEEP macro added.
;                       - NO_ILLEGAL_OPCODES switch implemented
; 1.0 22/MAR/2003   Initial release

; Note: These macros use illegal opcodes.  To disable illegal opcode usage,
;   define the symbol NO_ILLEGAL_OPCODES (-DNO_ILLEGAL_OPCODES=1 on command-line).
;   If you do not allow illegal opcode usage, you must include this file
;   *after* including VCS.H (as the non-illegal opcodes access hardware
;   registers and require them to be defined first).

; Available macros...
;   SLEEP n             - sleep for n cycles
;   VERTICAL_SYNC       - correct 3 scanline vertical synch code
;   CLEAN_START         - set machine to known state on startup
;   SET_POINTER         - load a 16-bit absolute to a 16-bit variable

; SLEEP duration
; Original author: Thomas Jentzsch
; Inserts code which takes the specified number of cycles to execute.  This is
; useful for code where precise timing is required.
; ILLEGAL-OPCODE VERSION DOES NOT AFFECT FLAGS OR REGISTERS.
; LEGAL OPCODE VERSION MAY AFFECT FLAGS
; Uses illegal opcode (DASM 2.20.01 onwards).

; CLEAN_START
; Original author: Andrew Davie
; Standardised start-up code, clears stack, all TIA registers and RAM to 0
; Sets stack pointer to $FF, and all registers to 0
; Sets decimal mode off, sets interrupt flag (kind of un-necessary)
; Use as very first section of code on boot (ie: at reset)
; Code written to minimise total ROM usage - uses weird 6502 knowledge :)

; SET_POINTER
; Original author: Manuel Rotschkar

; Sets a 2 byte RAM pointer to an absolute address.
;
; Usage: SET_POINTER pointer, address
; Example: SET_POINTER SpritePTR, SpriteData
;
; Note: Alters the accumulator, NZ flags
; IN 1: 2 byte RAM location reserved for pointer
; IN 2: absolute address
